NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5% premium to Sambaâ€™s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf regionâ€™s third-largest lender. The entityâ€™s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle Eastâ€™s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets."
